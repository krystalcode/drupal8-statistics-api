Statistics API
==============

Description
-----------

The Statistics API module allows applications or other contrib modules to track
numerical entries, either globally or related to a specific entity or entity
type. Examples are:

* How many times a specific content item has been viewed in general.
* How many times a specific page has been viewed by a specific user.
* How many times a specific user has logged in.
* How many times a specific file has been downloaded by anyone on the site.
* How many orders have been placed by a user.

Usage
-----

The Statistics API module does not provide any features by itself. It needs to
be utilized by another module to implement meaningful functionality.

Examples:

```
// Set to 12 the number of orders belonging to user 1.
$statistics_storage->insertOrUpdate(
  'nb_entities',
  12,
  'commerce_order',
  0,
  1
);
```

```
// Increment the number of views the content item with ID 1has received.
$statistics_storage->increment('nb_views', 'node', 1);
```

```
// Fetch the number of views the content item with ID 1 has received.
$statistics_storage->fetchValue('nb_views', 'node', 1);
```

```
// Fetch the number of times the inviation with ID 1 was sent and viewed.
$statistics_storage->fetchMultipleValues(
  ['nb_sent', 'nb_viewed'],
  'invitation',
  1
);
```
